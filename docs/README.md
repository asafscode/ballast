# Ballast
### Keep your audio balance from drifting!

There is, *still*, a long standing MacOS bug where your balance may drift when volume buttons are pressed while CPU is under heavy load 🤷‍♀️.

Ever noticed your audio not quite right? Only to discover your audio balance slightly off 😔

This free app keeps your balance stable and center and lives in your Menu Bar.

## FAQ

- **Why can I not open the app after installing?**<br>
  As a security measure MacOS won't open apps from unidentified developers.
  This is because I do not have an Apple Developers subscription, so cannot sign the app.
